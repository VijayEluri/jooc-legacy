=== Guidelines to packagers ====

Packagers can use spec files to build rpm. ooc-fedora.spec file works fine with Fedora and/or Centos.

As RPM can produce multiple rpm from a complete installed base, you'd rather to get every external libs to create packages.
Here is a list of external libs that you can get to produce RPM:
    * ooc-gtk
    * ooc-gdk
    * ooc-docs
    * ooc-tubes

For now, there is no 0.3 release, so packages are build from a 'git-date' revision. For example, package build against a extraction on November, 2d 2009, is released as ooc-0.3.git20091102. 

The current specfile create this rpms:
    ooc
    ooc-gtk (depends on ooc-gdk)
    ooc-gdk

Note that ooc-gtk provides dependence on "gtk2-devel".

As soon as releases are ready, we will release package as "stable".

=== Preparation ===

Prepare an build environnement, from your home directory, type on terminal:
 $ su -c "yum insall rpmdevtools"
 $ rpmdev-setuptree

Then, prepare you tarballs like this, replace VERSION with release or git`date +"%Y%m%d"`:
copy your ooc directory to "ooc-0.3.gitVERSION", then:

 $ tar cvfj ooc-0.3.gitVERSION.tar.bz2 ooc-0.3.gitVERSION

Do the same with ooc-gtk, ooc-gdk... etc...
   * Copy every tarballs into $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCE
   * Copy ooc/packages/ooc-fedora.spec to $HOME/rpmbuild/SPEC

You can now try:
$ rpmbuild -bp ~/rpmbuild/SPEC/ooc-fedora.spec
$ rpmbuild -bc ~/rpmbuild/SPEC/ooc-fedora.spec
$ rpmbuild -bi ~/rpmbuild/SPEC/ooc-fedora.spec

If everything seems to be ok, you can produce binary package and source rpm.

Warning, it's not recommanded to give binary packages that are **not** produced by "mock". Please, follow the next step.

=== Use mock ===

Mock is a fedora software that produce rpms for multiple platforms (if you are on x86_64 computer, you can produce i586 rpm). It can produce rpm for old fedora, next fedora, and Centos. Everything from an only one computer.

First, install mock:
 $ su -c "yum install mock"

Then produce a srpm package:
$ rpmbuild -bs  ~/rpmbuild/SPEC/ooc-fedora.spec

Now, produce rpm for fedora 11:
$ mkdir results
$ mock -v -r fedora-11-i586 ~/rpmbuild/SRPM/ooc-0.3.gitVERSION.srpm --resultdir ./results

You can try to produce centos packages, rawhide (next version), or EPEL (Centos) package by changing fedora-11-i586 (or fedora-11-x86_64) by the release you need. Every targets are listed by this command:
$ ls /etc/mock/*.cfg

=== For other RPM plateforms ===

There are a lot of rpm based distributions, as OpenSuse, Mandriva, etc...

Please, copy fedora spec file and change configuration to be standard to your target distribution. Fedora spec files are not fully compatible with Mandriva, that is not compatible with OpenSuse, etc... 
Be sure to test your packages before giving to communitiy.
