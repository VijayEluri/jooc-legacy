ooc
===

An ooc compiler, written in Java.

This is the initial prototype implementation of the ooc programming language.
It's been proven stable enough to compile a 60+ classes project throughout its
development. So it's a good starting point.

However, another effort is going on at the moment to implement an ooc
compiler in ooc itself. The goals are to go slowly and carefully to implement
it as correctly as possible. "Testing first =)"

Getting Started
===============

The 'executable' is dist/ooc.jar. You can launch it like that:
	java -jar dist/ooc.jar

But for convenience, you can also use the launch-ooc.sh script

OOC_DIST:
	The OOC_DIST environment variable, if set to the directory
	where you installed ooc (e.g. directory with "libs", "sdk",
	"dist", "examples", etc.) it allows the compiler to set the
	libpath etc. by itself, if empty.

backends:
	ooc now defaults to the gcc backend, with clean=on, and
	outpath in the current directory. It allows for the quick
	and dirty.

commandline:
	you can "ln -s $OOC_DIST/launch-ooc.sh /usr/bin/ooc" or
	wherever you want, if you want to be able to launch ooc
	easily
