## j/ooc

This is the legacy implementation of the ooc programming language.

It's written in Java, and is (probably) bug-ridden. It supports a very
old version of the langauge. Only use this codebase to make fun of my
early attempts at implementing a language!

For a much better and more modern implementation of ooc, take a 
look at rock: https://github.com/nddrylliog/rock
