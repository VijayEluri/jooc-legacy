=============================================

This is the new, 0.3 ooc compiler. It now has most features from 0.2, is faster, more lightweight and
more robust. Also the syntax has been revised, see http://ooc-lang.org/syntax

ooc is a modern, object-oriented, functional-ish, high-level, low-level, sexy programming language. it's translated to pure C with a source-to-source compiler. it thrives to be powerful, modular, extensible, portable, yet simple and fast.

Here is the obligatory hello world in ooc:

---------------------------------------------
"Hi, world =)" println()
---------------------------------------------
