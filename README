This is the new, 0.3 ooc compiler. It now has most features from 0.2, is faster, lighter and
more robust. Also the syntax has been revised, see http://ooc-lang.org/syntax

ooc is a modern, object-oriented, functional-ish, high-level, low-level, sexy programming
language. it's translated to pure C with a source-to-source compiler. it strives to be
powerful, modular, extensible, portable, yet simple and fast.

ooc is distributed under the terms of the BSD license. See the LICENSE file for more
information.

Here is the obligatory hello world in ooc:

---------------------------------------------
"Hi, world =)" println()
