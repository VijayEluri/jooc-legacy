lang package rules:
  - Every class outside lang.* import every lang.* class automatically
  - In lang.*, classes don't import each other automatically (to avoid circular dependencies)
  - All covers must be first defined in ooclib.ooc, then additional functions must go in their
    dedicated file (e.g. String.ooc, Char.ooc)

Note: defining covers twice (or more!) is never a problem for the ooc compiler.
The second, third, etc. definitions aren't allowed to add members / change the
from-type, but should be used to add functions.
